Sonic Annotator Web Application
===============================

This python program generates and serves a web interface for 
Vamp plugins available on the system and allows 
feature extraction of uploaded audio files using Sonic Annotator.

An example of a generated html page can be found in ./examples

REQUIREMENTS:

Cherrypy (web server)
Sonic Annotator
Cheetah template library
Mopy 
Musicbrainz2 library
...more to come here

TODO:

*This is really in the phase of "testing ideas" but 
 already quite usable

*Display enhanced plugin information using mopy+vamp ontology
*Finalize JSON generator for mb data (maybe use mopy e.g. like GNAT)
*Post process RDF output to include metadata from musicbrainz
*Visualisations of RDF (e.g. using Matplotlib/ Flash interface)
*Cache the resulting RDF on the Virtuoso server (Kurt?) 
Any more ideas?
